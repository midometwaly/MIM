Requirements

For development, you will need jdk-8u161 and netbeans-8.2-windows installed on your environement

Installing

Microsoft Windows : For Windows platforms, you can download and run an .exe point-and-click installer that guides you through the required steps.
Unix : Several .bin executable Installshield installers are available for various Unix platforms. You may need to make these executable before running:
$ chmod +x NetBeans.bin 
$ ./NetBeans.bin
While the installer will search for any installed JDK versions, and prompt you for which JDK version you should use, you can speed the install up by specifying a JDK version on the command line:

$ ./NetBeans.bin -is:javahome <path_to_your_jdk>
Mac OS X :
Untar or unzip to extract NetBeans. Note: unzip is part of the developer tools, so it is not available in a normal installation. To untar, use gnutar instead of tar.
To launch NetBeans IDE open the Terminal application and go to the netbeans/bin directory.
Start NetBeans IDE in the standard look and feel using the following command:
./runide.sh -jdkhome /Library/Java/Home

The -jdkhome switch can be omitted if you set the environment variable JAVA_PATH or JDK_HOME to /Library/Java/Home

NetBeans IDE can be started in the Aqua look and feel using:
./runide.sh -jdkhome /Library/Java/Home -ui com.apple.mrj.swing.MacLookAndFeel -fontsize 10
